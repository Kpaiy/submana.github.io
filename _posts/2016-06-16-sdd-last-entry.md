The night before the project is due. The actual game portion is complete, I'll probably be working on it a bit tomorrow to clean up the code and add some better comments, but for now that's it. I won't be too sad if I don't get a chance to polish it, it's pretty good as it is. As for the documentation, most of it is complete, I just need to compile some test data and implement it to the website.
