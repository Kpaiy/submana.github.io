I've gotten assets off opengameart.org, and as such I can make the game look more than just rectangles on a black background. I've also revamped my menu, so it actually has custom fonts of some form. This is a great update, because now my game looks a ton better, and more like a game! Not focusing on documentation right now, more on actually getting this game to a presentable state. Currently no way to lose or win the game, just a little character that can walk across the screen.
