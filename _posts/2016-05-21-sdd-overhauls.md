I've done a complete overhaul of my entire game, pulling code out of my original files and organising it so it makes a lot more sense. I've saved a lot of space, and a memory leakage error I had no longer occurs. I never did figure out what caused that, but it's fine since it's gone now. I'll make sure to keep monitoring memory usage each update so that this doesn't happen again. No documentation progress.
