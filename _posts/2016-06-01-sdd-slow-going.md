Building the game, but I'm not sure if I like how it plays. There's currently only one map. I need to make sure I have the assets quickly, so I can keep creting levels for the player to go through. I am currently not sure if I'm going to have a battle system or not, but I'm leaning towards not. This is because I believe I do not have the expertise to do it in a reasonable amount of time. Documentation = 0 progress.
