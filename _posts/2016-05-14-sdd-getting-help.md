Collision works now! After struggling with it for days, travis came and did it for me in like, 20 minutes. He walked me through it, and I understand it completely now. Really cool! I'm excited to keep working on the project now. I'd like to get more assets to make different kinds of levels, and see if I can't start working on the battle system soon. I'm not sure if it's going to be turn-based or real time or even be in the game at all, but I should decide soon.
