Now is probably as good a time as any to start my project. I could have done this a lot sooner, however I didn't, but I'm starting now! I've decided to move to love2d rather than using pygame, as this looks a heck of a lot nicer than my original plan. It won't be too bad, since I didn't know how to use pygame either, so learning this won't take much more time than python would. The scope of my project has changed too, rather than having a full RPG with all sorts of fancy assets, it's going to be relatively short with maybe one chapter or main level. However, hopefully I'll get shops and battles and everything in there. Anyway, documentation is on the backburner for now as I'd rather have a project to hand in.
