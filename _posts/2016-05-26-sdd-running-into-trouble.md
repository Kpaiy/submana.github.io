Overhauling my game broke animations of some sort, and for the life of me I could not remember how I did the animation function, so I've spent the past week very very stressed out. I did, however, fix it, and I have a slightly different function that I think works a little bit less efficiently. However, it's something, and I'll just have to be more careful and keep better records of old data next time.
